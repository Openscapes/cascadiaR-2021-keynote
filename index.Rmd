Hi everyone! I'm Julie Lowndes, and I'm founder and co-director of Openscapes. 

I'm excited to talk today about Open science as a movement and the art of Openscapes with my collaborator and friend Dr. Allison Horst!

# Open science

some way to illustrate tools/infrastructure separated from ideology

<!---
### Open science is transparency at all stages of the research process, coupled with free and open access to data, code, and papers

source: [*Hampton et al. 2015* The Tao of open science for ecology](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1890/ES14-00402.1)

I did not set out to be a champion for open science. I understood understood the Ideology (open knowledge is better for everything) but it seemed very far from my day-to-day as a marine ecologist, collecting data on boat etc. And I didn't know much about the technology and infrastructure that facilitate and enable open science, like open source products enable sharing, distribution, archiving. 

Disconnect between tools and ideology. And none of this seemed relevant to me as I struggled with my data analysis —

???
(rapid walk-through)
I was lonely and demoralized when it came to data analysis. I kept having situations where I couldn't solve the problem in front of me with the skillsets I had, whether this was learning to code in a total panic by myself or collaborating with others through forwarded emails with attachments like data_analys_final_final_final.xls

But open science open data science changed all that for me: it was more powerful than I ever imagined, and has not only helped me solve challenges ahead of me, it's broadened my imagination of what is possible with the research questions I can ask and how I can contribute to science through communication and publishing on the open web.

And really that is because of the open data science community. These are the folks creating open and inclusive tools for data science.  The idea that we are motivated by the same vision of inclusion and reproducibility and transparency and efficiency, and we all come at it with different motivations and experiences and bring different expertise and ideas so that together we can learn more and do more and be better.

# Open data science

illustration of the tools/ideology with communities and people logos?
This sounds like the r4ds illustration. or the hands. 

ROpenSci, RLadies, RStudio, Carpentries, Mozilla logos / pics of unconfs 

Nature paper

[rework this lang]

For me, the #rstats community was this entryway to open science. Open data science. This made me feel included and part of something that helped me do my science better in less time.

This helped us reimagine our data analysis with the Ocean Health Index. helped us articulate reproduciblity woes and solutions, and collab and comms


<!--- 
rOpenSci welcomed me to this community as a quite timid new coder and introduced me to seasoned developers who valued my questions and contributions. RStudio leadership has been a huge part of my path as well....

Through the Carpentries I learned how to teach with empathy for my learners, and we started a Mozilla study group called Eco-Data-Science in 2016 and and RLadies chapter in 2018. RLadies has been so transformational in my life and has helped me become the feminist I want to be: which is about supporting women and gender minorities, and thinking about data feminism as a way to examine and challenge power (cite)

# Open science as a movement

## Kinder, inclusive, collaborative science

<!---
"Good communities don't make themselves. We've got a lot to be grateful for, and we all have to do our part to keep it going" — Robin Wall Kimmerer's Dad, *Braiding Sweetgrass*

--->

???

All of this together makes open science a movement: a movement towards kinder, inclusive, and  collaborative science.  

Taking inspiration from the Get Out The Vote movements and All We Can Save

# Openscapes: Let's do better science in less time, together

???

This is really the thinking of Openscapes: how do we welcome other researchers to the open science movement? How can we learn from my experience and scale it? 

How can we do something more radical, outside of the traditional science lanes, that helps inspire and welcome researchers to help seed culture change?

Different ways of contributing and getting credit in science, make it less lonely?

# Openscapes: investing in welcome

???

Investing in artwork is just one of **many** ways that Openscapes is a leader in creating welcoming entryways into open science. 

Hi everyone, I'm Allison - and as a past Openscapes mentee *and* artist for Openscapes, I'm really honored that Julie asked me to join her for this talk to share a bit more about my experience as an Openscapes artist and Champion. 

---

[Example here: illustration + twitter response?]

???

Artwork can help tell a story that connects with people (you might have reacted to Julie's Star Wars analogy and images), and can help people feel like a new concept, topic, or even field is open to them. 

---

???

Working with Julie on Openscapes artwork also created a welcoming entry for me...

I started drawing illustrations for my own statistics and data analysis courses back around 2013 and had created some one-off pieces for publications, but working with Julie to illustrate Openscapes was the first time I felt my artwork was professionally valued as an important part of an organization's vision. It also kicked off a series of collaborations, including as Artist-in-Residence with the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis and RStudio. 

This ripple effect of Openscapes' leadership in investing in creative contributions...something something...

But I haven't just been empowered by Openscapes' investment in welcoming artwork - I've also reimagined my "actual job" (teaching environmental data science) based on what I learned through mentorship in the Openscapes Champions program. Julie, do you mind telling us a bit more about the Champions program? (so cheesy but this might work if we're going full cheese on the Brady Bunch style co-presenting)...

# Openscapes Champions Program

Remote cohort-based mentorship program for research teams

What is Openscapes Champions & why is it so impactful & different (e.g. length, teams, etc.)

???

TODO What is Champions, distinguish the delivery mech. TEAMS, professional dev. Less burden on leads, benefit to all
This isn’t a short workshop. Long-term mentoring SAY THIS CLEARLY
Onboarding. reducing burden from team leads, especically for early career faculty

Wanted something to complement short course 2-day workshops. Thinking: teams. Thinking: how to attract folks not yet ready to sign up for a 2-day? What aabout individuals who have taken one but want to establish those practices as a team? how to make less lonely, less of a burden?



---
(Zoom faces & logos)

???

So far: academia, NOAA x2, NASA, CSU, CSS, Env Canada 
Visuals Zoom faces and Logos of all of these. Each individ campuses, Cornell etc

helping groups see themselves as a team. work more openly within the team, within the cohort, and beyond.
similiarities of data issues, not differences in specific research topic

---

Examples of what we talk about 

- R Markdown
- Onboarding docs & Codes of Conduct
- Anti-racism & inclusion

## Allison Openscapes experience 

### 3 minutes (3 slides?)

???

So *how* has participating in the Champions program changed how I work and teach in environmental data science? Through Openscapes I: 

1. Overhauled tools & skills to modernize my course for collaborative & team data science, and now teach those in courses - impact is broad.

1. Implemented strategies to work more efficiently as a teacher and colleague - I'm a better colleague to my future self. 

1. Got braver! I started sharing my materials more openly, even if they weren't finished -- and now am happily contributing to open educational resources. 

---

- I teach ~100 students in an introductory data science course at UCSB each year, and all of them are benefitting from what I learned and continue learning from Openscapes.

[image: email from students]

??? 

This makes me a happier & more impactful teacher, and empowers students to be leaders & teachers. 

---

- Scaling out impact? 

- Value in confidence building 

- A community at UCSB

- End on growth & ripple effect here, leading into Julie's section on learning & iterating

---

# Julie: we're learning & iterating (3 minute section)

- Learning w/ Tara & Dawn
- Putting kinder science up from (not hidden behind DS)
- Artwork is a part of our grants
- Also investing in DEI (line item in grants, etc.)
- cite: blog posts with Dawn Wright and Tara Robertson

???

Artwork is now a line-item in our grants. We want to support creative efforts
DEI expertise in our grants. We’re investing in many things that are important to support/prioritize: Paying for expertise we value in addition to trying to learn on our own

# Learning & iterating represented in artwork (Allison - 2 min)

- Doodles > Sketches > Drafts > Final
- How this captures changes in Openscapes? 
- tidydata series?
